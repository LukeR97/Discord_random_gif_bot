# Discord_random_gif_bot

Bot that will select a random word from RandomWords library 
https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/

That random word is then used to search for a Tenor gif and post the top gif to a discord server.

This is using the latest Discord.py version and implements Discord intents.

The bot command is '$' so '$gif' to get a gif from it
